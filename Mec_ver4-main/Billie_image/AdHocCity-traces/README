The bus mobility traces are described in:

The traces in this directory correspond to several weeks worth of data.

Each line in the traces is formatted as follows:

<month>-<day>:<time> <bus_id> <route_id> <unknown> <x_coord> <y_coord> 

The route_id signifies the route followed by a bus.  Multiple buses may follow a given 
bus route at any time.  The x and y coordinates are in feet and were computed from the 
latitude and longitude values reported in the raw traces.
